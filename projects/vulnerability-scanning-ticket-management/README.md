# Vulnerability Scanning and Ticket Management

## Overview
This project documents my experience running non‑credentialed and credentialed Nessus scans across Windows and Linux systems, capturing logs, and managing vulnerability tickets. It also covers using Nmap for port scanning and reviewing host event logs. The goal was to identify vulnerabilities, prioritize remediation, and understand the value of credentialed access in vulnerability assessment.

## What I Did

- **Non‑Credentialed Nessus Scan:** Performed an initial scan of all servers and workstations without credentials. The scan completed successfully and provided a baseline of externally visible vulnerabilities【325644876431237†L7-L23】.
- **Credentialed Nessus Scan:** Conducted a deeper scan of Windows and Linux systems using valid credentials to detect additional vulnerabilities and misconfigurations【325644876431237†L16-L23】.
- **Vulnerability Ticketing:** Generated a set of vulnerability tickets in an Excel spreadsheet to track remediation. Each ticket includes the VM name, IP address, vulnerability title, severity, plugin ID, description and recommended fix. For example, unsupported Unix OS versions were flagged as critical with the recommended fix to upgrade to a supported release.
- **Log File Access:** Reviewed logs on Windows and Linux hosts. Used the Windows Event Viewer (`eventvwr`) to inspect System, Security and Application logs. On Linux, navigated to `/var/log` and used commands like `cat`, `less` and `tail -f` to read `syslog`, `auth.log` and `dmesg`【325644876431237†L27-L49】.
- **Port Scanning with Nmap:** Ran a stealth SYN scan (`nmap -sS -p-`) from Kali Linux against each server to enumerate open ports and validate services【325644876431237†L50-L55】.

## Lessons Learned

- **Credentialed vs Non‑credentialed Scans:** Providing credentials allows Nessus to perform authenticated checks that reveal many more vulnerabilities than an unauthenticated scan.
- **Centralized Ticket Tracking:** Using a spreadsheet to track vulnerabilities, severities and recommended fixes simplifies remediation and ensures issues are not overlooked.
- **Log Analysis:** Knowing how to access and interpret Windows and Linux logs is essential for confirming findings and investigating incidents.
- **Comprehensive Assessment:** Combining Nessus scans with Nmap port scanning and manual log review provides a more complete security assessment.

## Next Steps

- Automate ticket generation by exporting Nessus scan results directly into a tracking system.
- Correlate vulnerabilities with patch management schedules to prioritize fixes.
- Schedule recurring credentialed scans and periodic Nmap sweeps to monitor for new exposures.
