# Vulnerability Remediation Report

## Overview

This report summarises vulnerability remediation efforts across several lab hosts using Nessus scans, manual patching and risk acceptance. It documents the initial findings, fixes applied, remaining issues, top medium vulnerabilities, deployment of Velociraptor for digital forensics and incident response, and a scan update showing reductions in critical and high vulnerabilities.

## Host Summaries and Fixes

- **VM 172.17.1.102 (Windows 10)** – Identified vulnerabilities included CVE-2019-0708 (BlueKeep), SMBv1 enabled and missing cumulative updates. Remediation involved disabling SMBv1 via PowerShell, installing cumulative patches, and verifying the build version after reboot, which resolved all critical issues【744607402137117†L8-L20】.
- **VM 172.16.1.1 (OPNsense firewall)** – A Unix unsupported version vulnerability could not be patched due to hardware limitations. The team restricted external firewall access and documented risk acceptance with compensating controls【744607402137117†L22-L33】.
- **VM 172.17.1.2 (Windows Server 2008 R2)** – Critical DNS (SIGRed) and MS11-058 vulnerabilities were found. Attempts to patch via Windows Update failed, so SMB1 was disabled and system hardening applied; offline or WSUS patching was recommended【744607402137117†L35-L49】.
- **VM 172.16.1.100 (Windows 10)** – Addressed a SWEET32 medium cipher vulnerability by updating the OS, disabling SMBv1, and beginning TLS cipher hardening. Additional tuning remained【744607402137117†L50-L56】.

## Open Issues and Recommendations

Unresolved issues included unsupported firewall OS, patch failures on Windows Server, and TLS hardening. Recommendations called for hardware replacement, offline/WSUS patching, and configuring Group Policy to enforce modern TLS suites【744607402137117†L60-L71】.

## Top Medium Vulnerabilities & Fix Plans

The team prioritised five medium vulnerabilities from Nessus scans and outlined fixes【744607402137117†L72-L99】:
1. **HSTS Missing** – Enable HTTP Strict Transport Security headers on web servers.
2. **Untrusted SSL Certificates** – Replace certificates with those issued by trusted authorities.
3. **Self-Signed Certificates** – Deploy CA-signed certificates to avoid MITM risks.
4. **Expired Certificates** – Renew and replace expired SSL certificates.
5. **NTP Mode 6 Scanner** – Restrict NTP access to internal hosts and disable Mode 6 queries.

## Velociraptor DFIR Deployment

To improve endpoint visibility and incident response, Velociraptor was deployed in the lab. The team downloaded the binary, made it executable, generated a server configuration (self-signed SSL, Linux host, /opt/velociraptor data store), and launched the server【744607402137117†L102-L139】. Velociraptor enables forensic artifact collection, live memory and disk analysis, IOC searches, and proactive threat hunting【744607402137117†L140-L143】.

## Nessus Scan Update

A subsequent Nessus scan on July 27 2025 compared results with the previous week and showed significant improvements【744607402137117†L146-L190】:
- Host 172.16.1.3 went from 13 critical and 23 high findings to zero critical/high/medium vulnerabilities.
- Host 172.16.1.105 resolved 3 critical, 33 high and 25 medium findings, leaving only one low vulnerability.
- Host 172.17.1.2 reduced critical vulnerabilities from 74 to 3 and high from 316 to 0, with medium falling from 79 to 3.

Overall, critical vulnerabilities dropped by 92.5% and high vulnerabilities by 97%, demonstrating the effectiveness of remediation efforts【744607402137117†L185-L189】.

## Lessons Learned

- Timely patching and disabling legacy protocols like SMBv1 are crucial to eliminate high-risk vulnerabilities.
- Hardware limitations may necessitate risk acceptance and compensating controls.
- Prioritising medium vulnerabilities based on impact and exploitability ensures efficient remediation.
- Deploying DFIR tools such as Velociraptor provides valuable telemetry for incident response.
- Regular Nessus scans and metrics tracking illustrate progress and help focus remaining remediation work.

## Next Steps

- Complete patching of remaining critical vulnerabilities on Windows Server 2008 R2 and refine TLS cipher configurations on Windows 10.
- Continue monitoring with Nessus and review Velociraptor telemetry for early detection of new issues.
- Plan hardware upgrades for unsupported appliances to enable future patching.
