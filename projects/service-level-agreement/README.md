# Service Level Agreement (SLA) – Network Support

## Overview
This project contains a sanitized summary of a service level agreement (SLA) drafted as part of coursework. The SLA outlines network support services provided by an IT provider to a client. It defines the scope of services, reliability targets, responsiveness expectations, reporting procedures, performance monitoring, penalties for non‑compliance, and exceptions.

## Service Description
The agreement specifies tasks such as:
- Providing network support during business hours, including monitoring servers, workstations, printers and network equipment.
- Ensuring patch management, security controls, backups, upgrades and updates.
- Supporting users through a help desk and delivering services both onsite and remotely as needed【391603739241609†L56-L76】.

## Reliability
The SLA targets high availability of the network and critical applications during business hours, with proactive maintenance and emergency support. Scheduled maintenance is coordinated with the client, and the provider aims for at least 99 % uptime【391603739241609†L87-L98】.

## Responsiveness
It defines response and resolution times based on severity levels, tracked through a ticketing system. Critical issues receive a response within two hours and resolution within one business day; serious issues within four hours and resolution within two business days; moderate issues within one business day and resolution within three business days【391603739241609†L101-L124】.

## Reporting Procedure
Problems can be reported via phone, email or an online ticket system. The provider supplies monthly performance reports summarizing ticket data, response times and planned maintenance【391603739241609†L131-L147】.

## Performance Monitoring
The agreement specifies continuous monitoring of network performance using automated tools. It includes reviewing ticket reports and monthly meetings to assess performance against SLA metrics【391603739241609†L149-L167】.

## Penalties and Enforcement
If performance does not meet SLA targets, the provider credits the client's monthly fees proportional to the downtime. Continued non‑compliance triggers escalation steps and potential contract termination【391603739241609†L173-L186】.

## Constraints and Exceptions
The SLA does not apply to outages caused by third‑party providers, scheduled maintenance, force majeure events or client actions that violate the agreement【391603739241609†L188-L205】.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the ability to draft and interpret service level agreements, a key skill for IT professionals managing service delivery. The summary removes client‑specific details and focuses on the structure and essential components of an SLA.
