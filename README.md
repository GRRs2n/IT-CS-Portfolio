# Cybersecurity & IT Portfolio

Welcome to my combined cybersecurity and IT portfolio. This repository serves as a central hub to showcase selected projects from my studies and personal learning. Each project highlights my ability to build, secure, and document systems across IT infrastructure and security domains.

## About Me

I'm pursuing degrees in IT and Cybersecurity with the goal of becoming a security-minded IT specialist. My work focuses on deploying and securing real-world systems, automating routine tasks, and following best practices in hardening and incident response.

## Top Projects

Below are the key projects from this portfolio. They link to individual repositories with full documentation and source files.

- **Dockerized Node.js/Express Demo** – A minimal web service packaged in a Docker container, demonstrating how to containerize and deploy a simple application.
  Repository: [`javascript_files`](https://github.com/GRRs2n/javascript_files)

- **Multi-Tier Web Deployment (coming soon)** – Deploying a document management system across multiple Linux servers with load balancing and TLS.

- **Vulnerability Management Lab (coming soon)** – Performing a vulnerability scan with Nessus, prioritizing findings, and documenting remediation steps.

- **Firewall & Network Segmentation Lab (coming soon)** – Implementing firewall rules between subnets and validating least-privilege connectivity.

- **IAM Policies & RBAC (coming soon)** – Designing least-privilege access policies aligned to NIST 800‑53 controls.

- **Automation Scripts (coming soon)** – A collection of Bash/PowerShell scripts and Ansible playbooks to automate user management, patching, and log collection.
