# Cybersecurity & IT Portfolio

Welcome to my combined cybersecurity and IT portfolio. This repository serves as a central hub to showcase selected projects from my studies and personal learning. Each project highlights my ability to build, secure, and document systems across IT infrastructure and security domains.

## About Me

I'm pursuing degrees in IT and Cybersecurity with the goal of becoming a security-minded IT specialist. My work focuses on deploying and securing real-world systems, automating routine tasks, and following best practices in hardening and incident response.

## Top Projects

Below are the key projects from this portfolio. They link to individual repositories with full documentation and source files.

- **Containerization & Orchestration** – Projects on building and packaging applications with Docker, writing Dockerfiles, and orchestrating services with Docker Compose.
